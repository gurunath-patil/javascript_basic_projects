### Basic Calculator <a name="basic-calculator"></a>

This project implements a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

- **Description:** Users can enter numbers and choose an operation to perform. The script displays the calculated result.

### Auto Color Change <a name="auto-color-change"></a>

This project creates a dynamic webpage that automatically changes its background color at regular intervals.

- **Description:** The background color transitions through a defined set of colors or generates random colors.

### Change Background on Click <a name="change-the-background-when-click-on-color"></a>

This project allows users to change the background color of a webpage by clicking on colored buttons or elements.

### Guess the Number Game <a name="guess-number-basic-game"></a>

This project creates a simple guessing game where users try to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range.
